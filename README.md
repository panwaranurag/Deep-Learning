# Deep Neural Network
Project part of deep learning
Designed deep neural network from scratch
- Input file: hw2_data4.txt
- Number of attributes/input neurons = 3 (Program calculate automatocally based on input file you provide)
- Number of output neurons = 2 (Classification problem with 2 class labels)
- Hidden layer: User defined on runtime
- Number of neurons in each hidden layer: User defined as an argument

* Developed feed-forward and back-propagation from scratch
* Implemented Dropout to overcome problem of overfitting
* Investigated performance of sigmoid, relu and tanh as activation function (Perceptrons)
* Implemented stochastic gradient descent for faster training
* Applied centralization and normalization to training data
