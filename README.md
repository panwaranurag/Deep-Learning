# Deep Neural Network
Project part of deep learning
Designed deep neural network from scratch

* Developed feed-forward and back-propagation from scratch
* Implemented Dropout to overcome problem of overfitting
* Investigated performance of sigmoid, relu and tanh as activation function (Perceptrons)
* Implemented stochastic gradient descent for faster training
* Applied centralization and normalization to training data
